WordPress is open source software.WordPress started in 2003 when Mike Little 
and Matt Mullenweg created a fork of b2/cafelog. The need for an elegant, 
well-architected personal publishing system was clear even then. 
Today, WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL, and licensed under the GPLv2. 
It is also the platform of choice for over 43% of all sites across the web.
